# Scenario 2

Similar to Scenario 1 but this time we have more data - how the recording was
done and how the playing looked and the file too!

Issues noticed and some doubts

- When the playing starts, there's a highlight on the comment "//"
- Playing stuck at one point and then suddenly goes fast. Whenever we do fast
  undos or something the issue seems to occur
- I'm also doubting that it has go to do something with the time taken during
  the video. Like, if I had finished the recording within some time / little
  time it would have all worked fine. But seems like long recordings have some
  problem at some point - at some threshold or some magic number. Not sure though.

What's Working:
Simple highlights / selections in the first part of the playing works mostly.
Interesting. Not much mishaps this time like last time. Not sure. Hmm

Next steps:
Gotta check the two video recordings of the recording and the playing side by
side to see what went wrong.
