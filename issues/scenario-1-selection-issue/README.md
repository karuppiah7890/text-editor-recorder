# Scenario 1

This issue occurred when I tried to implement selection feature.

Version - Commit SHA - `0f0a59dcf3ea86f39762b2d7f6353a6e1c3854a3`

Recording file - [0f0a59dcf3ea86f39762b2d7f6353a6e1c3854a3.textrec](0f0a59dcf3ea86f39762b2d7f6353a6e1c3854a3.textrec)

While playing there was a big pause. While recording also maybe there were
some issues as the recording file looks fishy - a lot of the start times have
the same value - `104292`
