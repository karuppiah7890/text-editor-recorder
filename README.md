# text-editor-recorder

This is a completely offline web application which helps you record when you
type in a web based text editor and also play it back later.

## Demos

I have recorded demos of various versions of the tool. The top most is the
latest, and the bottom most is the oldest :)

- Text Editor Recorder Player: Demo 2 - Cursor Movement Recording and Playing

## Applications

I have personally seen a few applications for this kind of tool.

- Coding tutorial instructors using such tools to record and playback the
  recording for the participants who are learning.
  Example: https://scrimba.com . The same concept can be generalized to
  teachers using it to teach coding to students
- Interview coding rounds to understand how the interviewee's code evolved from
  the first line of code. Personally I don't like this application but I have
  seen some platforms and services provide this feature for recruiters.

## Inspiration

This tool has been inspired by some existing things out there.

- https://asciinema.org/ - Open Source Tool for recording and playing terminal
  sessions. I learned some algorithms for playing recording from asciinema
  Python code.
- https://scrimba.com/ - Their courses show instructor typing code in actual
  editor and user can copy the code or even modify it in the same editor and
  save it separately. The tutorial can be fast forwarded and one can go back
  too, and pause too. There's also the instructor voice in the background as
  audio. It has a pretty cool UI :)
  Example - https://scrimba.com/scrim/cV7M2uR?pl=p7P5Hd
- https://www.openreplay.com/ - Recording and playing browser usage. Browser
  Sessions. Also, streaming browser usage live

## Future Ideas

- Extension in any software to do recording, playing, streaming - of the usage of
  the software. Example softwares where usage can be tracked, recorded, played,
  streamed etc - Browser, Text Editor, Terminal. Can also create separate tool
  or software to do the recording. This can be called as Custom Recording of the
  software, instead of using video recording, screen recording tools

  Examples:
  - Visual Studio Code Extensions for recording, playing, streaming
    the text editor usage.
  - vim Extensions for recording, playing, streaming
    the text editor usage.
  - emacs Extensions for recording, playing, streaming
    the text editor usage.
  - Any Code Editor Extensions/plugins for recording, playing, streaming
    the text editor usage.
  - Chrome Extensions for recording, playing, streaming
    the browser usage.
  - Firefox Extensions for recording, playing, streaming
    the browser usage.
  - Any Browser Extensions/Plugins for recording, playing, streaming
    the browser usage.
  - Any Software Extensions/Plugins for recording, playing, streaming
    the browser usage.
